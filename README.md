# IBM-Machine-Learning-With-Python-Project
In this project we will be using certain algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and then will clean the data and after that step we will find certain answers like F1-score, Logloss and Jaccard value for all those algorithms that we will be applying on that dataset
